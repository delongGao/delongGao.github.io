- IEEE float number format
  - represent fractional numbers that are positive and negative in the following format
  `x = (S == 1 ? -1 : 1) * M * 2 ^ E`, where `M` is the `significant`, `E` is the `exponential`
  - three sections of the bit pattern:
    - `s`: sign bit: first, `0` for positive, `1` for negative
    - `e`: exponential bits: denoted as `k`, used to compute `E`, which is to represent: `* 2 ^ E`
    - `f`: fraction bits: representing he fractional parts of the number in binary format, only for the bits behind the binary point.
  - type of numbers that can be represented in this format:

    `bias = 2 ^ (k-1) - 1`

    | e (k bits)             | type          | E      | M |
    |---                     |---            |---     |---|
    |all `0`s                | De-Normalized |1 - bias| f |
    |not all `0` nor all `1`s| Normalized    |e - bias| 1 + f |
    |all `1`s                | Special cases: infinite, NaN | -- | -- |

  - Single v.s. Double
    - Single: 32 bits, 1 `sign` bit + 8 `e` bits + 23 `f` bits
    - Double: 64 bits, 1 `sign` bit + 11 `e` bits + 52 `f` bits
  - The normal process of converting and unsigned or integer bit pattern to its float representation:
    1. determine the `sign` bit by checking number is position or negative
    2. calculate the bias as `2 ^ (k - 1) - 1`, where `k` is `8` for single and `11` for double
    3. rewrite the number's bit pattern as the `f * 2 ^ E` format, which will give you `f` and `E`
        1. Normalized: `e = E + bias`
        2. De-normalized: `e = 1 + bias`
    4. padding `f` to the desired number of bits
    5. assemble all these together
  - When you compare the bit patterns of an unsigned or integer with the bit pattern for the same float number, there will be some bits pattern match each other, this comes from the `f` bits
