- unsigned to two's complment conversion
  - T2Uw(x):
    - x < 0: `2^w + x`
    - x >= 0: `x`
  - U2Tw(x):
    - x <= TMax: `x`
    - x > TMax: `x - 2^w`
  - In C
    - explicitly: casting, ex:
      ```c
      unsigned x = 12;
      (int) x
      ```
      this could also happen with `printf`
    - implicitly:
      - assign expression with one type to another:
      ```c
      unsigned x = 12;
      int y = x;
      ```
      - promotion rule: when two sides of the operator have different type, convert to unsigned, this also works the same for arithmetic operators:
      ```c
      2 < 8u // this will be converted to unsigned
      ```
  - bit extension
    - unsigned: zero extension - padding left with zeros
    - signed: sign extension - padding left with sign bit
    - both operations preserve the original value
    - combine type conversion and shifting, we could write some functions to extract bits with either zero extension or sign extension. Examples on __P116__
