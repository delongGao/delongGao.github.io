- unsigned numbers
  - Umin: 0b0000...0000 (all zeros)
  - Umax: 0b1111...1111 (all ones)
- signed numbers (two's complement)
  - MSB is sign bit, has negative weight
  - Tmin: 0b10000...0000 (all zeros EXCEPT first / sign bit)
  - Tmax: 0b01111...1111 (all ones EXCEPT first / sign bit)
- casting(type conversion between the two)
  - At least in C, the conversion happens at bit level
  - For both U2T and T2U, it converts to bit patterns first and use target way of interpreting bits
