- truncate numbers to `k` bits
  - unsigned: `num % (2 ^ k)`
  - two's complement: `U2T(num % (2 ^ k))` - be aware of negative numbers with modulo.
- unsigned addition:
  - `unsigned x, y of w bits`
  - `x + y <> 2 ^ w`: normal situation, no overflow. `x + y >= sum`
  - `2 ^ w <= x + y < 2 ^ (w+1)`: overflow, `x + y < sum`
  - this is basically raw addition with a truncate for overflow
  - principle for overflow detection:
  ```c
  int is_overflow(unsigned x, unsigned y) {
    unsigned sum = x + y;
    return sum < x;
  }
  ```
