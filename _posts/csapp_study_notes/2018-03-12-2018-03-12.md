- Float point rounding
  - round to even
  - round to zero
  - round up
  - round down
- Float operations
- One reflective note on converting values from integer to float:
  - should start from bit pattern
  - move the binary point around to form the format of `M * 2 ^ E`
  - from the exponential bits and fraction bits to see whether the number should be normal or denormal
  - calculate `e`
  - calculate `f`
  - assemble
