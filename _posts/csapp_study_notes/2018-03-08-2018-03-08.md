- TODO: I kind of missed the last bit about unsigned and two's complement numbers... Will need to review that part as needed.
- Float point value
  - binary representation of fractional values
  - binary point:
    - to the left: 2 ^ i
    - to the right: 2 ^ (-i)
  - can only accurately represent a finite subset of all possible values, example: `0.1` cannot be accurately represented in binary fractional form. Will have to __round__.
