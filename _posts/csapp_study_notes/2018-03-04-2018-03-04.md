- unsigned and two's complement negation
  - same as all previous operations, the bit level operation is actually the same, for two's complement numbers, the result is converted at the end.
  - bit level operations:
    - `-x = ~x + 1`
    - `for k = position of the right most '1' bit, complement all the bits left of k`
- multiplication
  - bit level: for `x` and `y` of `w` bits, `x * y` will require `2w` bits to represent, as a result, we truncate the result from `2w` to `w` bits.
  - unsigned: `calculate --> truncate`
  - two's complement: `calculate --> truncate --> convert`
  - detection of overflow
    - x or y is zero, cannot possibly have overflow
    - x and y not zero:
      - division: `int p = x * y; p / x == y;`. NOTE: I don't fully understand this part
      - use larger data type: `int64_t raw = x * y; raw == (int) raw;`. This makes sense: if overflow happened, the casted result will not equal itself.
    - Selected Exercises:
      - PP2.36, p135
      ```c
      int64_t raw = x * y;
      return raw == (int) raw;
      ```
      - PP2.37, p135
      ```c
      // my confusion for this part is why only casting the ele_size?
      uint64_t required_size = ele_cnt * (uint64_t) ele_size;
      size_t request_size = (size_t) required_size
      // detect overflow, if happened, just abort
      // this is because malloc can only take uint32_t
      if (required_size != request_size) {
        return NULL;
      }
      void *result = malloc(request_size);
      ```
