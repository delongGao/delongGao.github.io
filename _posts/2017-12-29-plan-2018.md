# 2018 Planning

### Knowledge Profile
- Bread and Butter: Ruby/Rails
- New interests: Go and Erlang
- Low level fundamentals: C (possibly C++ for games)

### Topics
- Low level fundamentals
  - Algorithms and Data structures
  - Computer theories
  - C programming

- Erlang and Go
  - Distributed Systems and concurrency
  - Multi-player game architecture
  - Concurrency pattern in Erlang
  - Concurrency pattern in Go

### Daily Plan
- 3 ~ 4 hours per day
- 1 hour CSAPP with exercises / 1 hour CLRS with 1 coding question, swapped daily, let's see, might need to be extended to 1.5 hour
- 1 hour Work extension with Ruby / Rails, either current work items or experimenting new ideas, also try to extend my knowledge on Ruby/Rails in general along the way.
- half hour of Erlang + half hour of Go

### Goals of 2018
- Finish CSAPP and CLRS along with all the exercises with serious quality
- Finish Leetcode ez and md level
- Truly know C and understands it's influences on other languages(Ruby, Go, probably Erlang?)
- Understand distributed systems and Erland and Go's concurrency patterns, also being able to use them to building usable apps. This means truly have these two languages in my tool belt
- Build one distributed system from scratch
- Build a game for real
- Build one app with locus theory(I already got some ideas...)
- Give 10 talks...
- Take notes of all above and put them in my blog
