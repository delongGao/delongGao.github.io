## Why Start Writing Stories?

This is a question I have to answer for myself. A lot of things have happened
and passed very quickly during the past three years. When I look back today, it
shocks me that I do not have any clear understandings of what happened exactly.
I'm at the early start of 2017, and I don't want to have the same feeling for
this year, so start changing today.

- what I see, as records;
- what I hear, as verification;
- what I think, as results.
