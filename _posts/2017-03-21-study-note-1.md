### 4. Median of Two Sorted Array
- category: array, merge sort
- questions: 
  1. I know this performance is not O(m+n), but is it O(log(m+n))? How to calculate it?
  2. having to store all previous numbers before mid point, is actually a waste, can we avoid it?
  3. having to allocate the extra space for the temp array is not ideal
